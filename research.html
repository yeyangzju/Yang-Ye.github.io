    <p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> we investigate the lead-lag relation in the cross-section of commodity returns. We estimate dynamic and directional networks for 32 commodities and then construct a new predictor termed commodity network momentum, exploring cross-commodity information spillover. Network momentum positively and significantly predicts future commodity returns, controlling for existing characteristics. Unlike existing lead-lag studies, the predictive relation is consistent with overreaction rather than underreaction. We provide evidence that the predictive relation is stronger for more attention-grabbing commodities. Extrapolation from connected commodities contributes to this relation. Overall, our paper highlights the role of information spillover in commodity return predictability. </p>
